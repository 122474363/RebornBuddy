# RebornBuddy

All my profiles require the custom behaviors, Please make sure you Checkout to a seperate folder named "Sodimm", and place it into the Plugins directory of your RebornBuddy folder. 

These behaviors will work on both x86 and x64 versions of RebornBuddy.

A Realm Reborn based profiles (2.0 & Ixal Dailies) should be, for the most part. AFKable. There are some tasks that the bot has trouble with, but I am working on trying to solve them within the custom behaviors.

Heavensward based profiles (3.0 & Moogle Dailies) Require ExMatts ExBuddy to function. Please be advised that ExBuddy can get stuck, and will get stuck. This is not an issue that is easily solved, and ExMatt should be praised for his amazing work. Until official flying support is released, these profiles will continue to require ExBuddy. As such, with the intermittent issues with RayCasting the profiles should not be AFKed. For the most part, they will do their job just fine, but on the odd occasion that Exbuddy gets stuck, it will require human intervention.

Its worth noting that; Yes, I could add custom hops for the flight to be more smooth in the Heavensward profiles; yet,  without knowing the exact combination or 3 quests you're likely to get, ExFlight will still run into problems. Please be mindful when submitting bugs, that anything involving the flight is beyond my control. Also please understand that although every effort is made to ensure a good experience, there are some things RebornBuddy just can not do. Without ExMatts efforts these profiles wouldn't even exsist, please respect that.

The Uldah 1-15 profile is to test the Custom Behaviors ability to Auto Navigate maps. Please be advised that this functionality is as the profile states, IN TESTING. I would appreciate reports of when and if it gets stuck. I have tested the profile on 6 new characters before releasing to public, and where there can be an issue or 2, the navigation is sound.
