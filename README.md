## Notes

Flight based profiles (Heavensward/Stormblood) Require ExMatts ExBuddy to function. Please be advised that ExBuddy can get stuck, and will get stuck. This is not an issue that is easily solved, and ExMatt should be praised for his amazing work. Until official flying support is released, these profiles will continue to require ExBuddy. As such, with the intermittent issues with RayCasting the profiles should not be AFKed. For the most part, they will do their job just fine, but on the odd occasion that Exbuddy gets stuck, it will require human intervention.
